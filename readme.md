# Ignite Talk
This assignment: **Due by Friday, 1/18 at 5pm**

## Directions for HW0

Read through the list of potential topics. In this file, edit the list so that it only contains your top three choices for a topic that you would like to study and on which you would like give a short presentation. Then, at the very bottom of this page, edit the schedule to your preferred section of the semester - would you rather give a presentation before, the midterm, or after?

Presentation Due: In class on the day that you are assigned

Ignite talks are short, rapid-fire presentations with a specific format. The purpose is to deliver a quick summary of a topic that is focused on the important highlights rather than getting caught up in the details. Presentations last exactly five minutes and consist of twenty slides. That means you get only 15 seconds per slide, so you need to move fast! This also means that slides tend to use a lot of images rather than having a lot of text and bullet points. Also, your slides auto-advance...so enlighten us, but do it quickly.

There are a number of great example Ignite talks running the gamut from informative to entertaining. Here are some examples to help you get started thinking about the format:

1. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1aq6sJEuVU">FIGHTING DIRTY IN SCRABBLE</a> by Mehal Shah
1. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1_OoICS2b8">Trading a Paperclip for a House</a> by Kyle MacDonald
1. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iommL5hITzA">Typography Faux Pas</a> by Jenny Lam

Slides are due for presenters before class on the day of the presentation.

## Guidelines for Presentation
The purpose of this talk is to review a visualization project or paper in a critical way, then share your critique with the class. Each ignite talk should include the following components:

- Information about the primary author, designer, or researcher responsible for creating the visualization project. Who are they? Is this project typical of the topics the author chooses? Have they done any other notable visualization projects?
- What type of data is the designer trying to create a visualization from? Is this data of interest to a particular audience? Why (or why not) is it important for this data to be analyzed?
- What are the tasks for this visualization? What interactions are available, if any? Can you describe the tasks using abstract language (e.g., correlating two attributes, showing change over time)? Is the project successful at achieving these goals?
- What are the details for the chosen visual representation? What encodings are present for the underlying data? Is this an effective way of representing that data?
- What alternatives are there for representing this data, or for exploring this topic (one or two examples are sufficient)? Are the alternative visualizations more effective, or less effective?
- Finally, did you personally like this visualization? Did you learn something? Did the visualization change your mind about the topic? Or, do you find yourself disagreeing with the visualization in some way?

## Available Projects

Here are the papers and projects that you may select for each topic. Other papers may be acceptable at the instructor's discretion, just get permission beforehand. Choose carefully! Most of all, the topic and paper should interest you. The projects differ in length of coverage: while a shorter paper or article may take less time to read, it will also mean that you have less material to work with for slides. In any case, you are encouraged to talk about how the projects relates to something that interests you. Remember, the point is to communicate the highlights while also engaging the class.
